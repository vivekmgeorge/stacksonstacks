#### Description 
We are revamping StackOverFlow for 2014. We believe we create a more simply design site with better functionality.

#### How to install the code locally 
1. Fork the folder
2. Bundle install
3. Run rake db:drop
4. Run rake db:create
5. Run rake db:migrate
6. Run rails s to see the app live locally

#### How to use the app
The app should be pretty self explanatory to use. Open it up and start asking questions and wait for great local community to answer all of your techincal questions :)
